# Traffic Density estimation using Open CV functions : Assignment-1


## Subtask-3 : Trade-off analysis of software design choices : Code
- The folder contains C++ files that implement the respective methods as mentioned in the Assignment-1, Subtask-3. In addition, dense optical flow has been implemented using concurrent programming.
- Additionally, the file `vid_cap_time.cpp`  is used for calculating the time taken in blindly reading the whole video. This data was used to validate a few explanations during the the analysis.
- Also, C++ codes to calculate the baseline output for the analysis are also added.
- Run `make all` to create all executables for relevant C++ files.
- Run `make clean` to  delete all text files and executables.
- The files corresponding to methods can be run by `make method-{method number}`.
- The executables can be run by following the suggestions that appear as a result to `make filename`.
