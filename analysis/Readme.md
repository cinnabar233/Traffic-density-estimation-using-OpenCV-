## Subtask-3 : Trade-off analysis of software design choices - Analysis
- The folder contains several subfolders corresponding to the different variants(Method-1 to Method-4, Sparse Optical Flow and Concurrent Dense Optical Flow and Baseline) of implementation in order to analyse the runtime-v/s-utility trade-off.  
- Each folder contains a baseline output along with the output files for various runs of the C++ files  in the `Code` directory along with a C++ script for error calculation. 
- The Concurrent Dense Optical Flow folder contains two subfolders correspoding to spatial and temporal multithreading.
- Additionally, there is a folder containing two Python scripts for plotting  purposes. 
- A LaTeX report is attached summarising the findings of the analysis.
